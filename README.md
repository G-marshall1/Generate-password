# Generate-password

## Description

- I love making password generator because I love random operations and the many ways you can make it.
- I chose to create a random password generator to allow users to make unique passwords. 
- I desided to create a password generator to show that I can create a simple for loop and function.
- By making this page, I learned about the attachment features that Javascript can offer and improve your html and css.
